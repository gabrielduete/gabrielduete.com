# Info

- A guide on how to solve problems on
  [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/p) using JavaScript.

- This article is also available in this
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gabrielduete/BEECROWD-JS-GUIA) along
  with some solutions I’ve already submitted.

Many developers struggle with solving Beecrowd problems using JavaScript due to
how the input is handled. Don’t worry, i’ll walk you through it:

First, create a file named `stdin` in your folder. We’ll use this file to
simulate the input from the problem!

Let’s solve problem
[1001](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt/problems/view/1001) from Beecrowd.
Start by declaring the input:

```js
var input = require('fs').readFileSync('stdin', 'utf8')
```

We’re using the Node.js built-in fs module (file system) to read from the stdin
file. This allows us to simulate input just like Beecrowd expects.

We're only using the readFileSync method to read the content synchronously as
UTF-8.

Let’s test it! Type 10 and 9, one per line, inside the stdin file, and then log
the input:

`console.log(input)` As expected, it prints 10 and 9. The input is correctly
being read from the file.

Now, split the input:

```
var valoresRecebidos = input.split('\n')
```

This creates an array of values by splitting the string at each newline
character (\n), which matches how Beecrowd formats its input.

Now let's extract the numbers into variables A and B:

Notice that a list of values was returned according to how we separated them! In
this case, using a line break as the problem requires.

Now it’s easy! We just need to store the values 10 and 9 in their respective
variables, A and B.

```

var A = parseInt(valoresRecebidos.shift())
var B = parseInt(valoresRecebidos.shift())

```

The shift() method removes the first item from the array and returns it. We use
parseInt() to ensure we’re working with integers.

Now calculate and print the result:

```
var X = A + B
```

Your full code should look like this:

```

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('stdin', 'utf8')

var valoresRecebidos = input.split('\n')

var A = parseInt(valoresRecebidos.shift()) var B =
parseInt(valoresRecebidos.shift())

var X = A + B

console.log('X = ' + X)

```

Let's test it to see if it's working as Beecrowd expects!

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3dccw3sq58qtv0pdaivm.png)

Test the code it works! But there’s one last detail…

The problem? On Beecrowd, the input is read from a different path. If you try
submitting this solution as-is, you’ll get a Runtime error.

To fix it, just change the file path to /dev/stdin:

```

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8')

```

Final solution:

```

var input = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin', 'utf8')

var valoresRecebidos = input.split('\n')

var A = parseInt(valoresRecebidos.shift()) var B =
parseInt(valoresRecebidos.shift())

var X = A + B

console.log('X = ' + X)

```

Congratulations! You’ve successfully solved Beecrowd problem 1001 using
JavaScript, the most beautiful language on the web (maybe).
