## Introduction

Understanding internet concepts is crucial in a programmer’s daily
routine—believe me! Grasping these terms can save you countless hours when
solving problems at work or dealing with production issues. It helps you
identify issues faster and troubleshoot with confidence.

Let’s explore the most basic and essential concepts of the internet.

# How HTTP Works

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol used on the
World Wide Web, i.e., it’s what allows communication between client and server.

Here's a simple diagram of an HTTP communication:

Notice that the user sends a request for certain data to the server — this is
called an `HTTP REQUEST`. The server receives the request and returns a response
— called an `HTTP RESPONSE`.

## HTTP Methods

### GET

The `GET` method requests a resource from the server, and the expected outcome
is the return of the requested data.

We can describe the `HTTP REQUEST` here as a `GET` method asking the server for
some data.

### HEAD

The `HEAD` method is similar to `GET`, except the response has no body — just
the headers.

## POST

The `POST` method sends data to the server, which then receives and stores the
data.

## PUT

The `PUT` method updates or replaces data on the server. You must send all the
necessary data to update the resource. If the resource (e.g., a user with
ID 1234) doesn't exist, `PUT` will create it; if it exists, it will update it.

## DELETE

The `DELETE` method is used to remove a specific resource.

## CONNECT

`CONNECT` is rarely used and is mainly for establishing a tunnel to a server
through a proxy — typically used in secure, proxy-based environments.

## OPTIONS

The `OPTIONS` method returns information about the server's communication
options. It's commonly used in application deployment platforms to retrieve
configuration details.

## PATCH

The `PATCH` method is similar to `PUT`, but it allows partial updates to a
resource (e.g., updating just the user's name). Unlike `PUT`, `PATCH` cannot
create a new resource.

## TRACE

The `TRACE` method is like a debug tool — it echoes the received request to test
what’s received on the server and verify the request path.

## Real Example

Let’s use a real-world example to understand `GET`.

When you open YouTube and search for a video, the site suggests results in real
time. If you inspect the browser’s **Network** tab, you can watch these HTTP
requests happen.

Check out the screenshots:

![request result](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mjnug7n42unayl5hybsa.png)

By clicking on the request in the Network tab and viewing the **Preview**,
you’ll see the server’s response — in this case, the video suggestions. The
response returned with a status code `200`, meaning success.

## HTTPS

HTTPS stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**. It’s similar to HTTP,
but with an added “S” for **Security**.

HTTPS adds an encryption layer using TLS/SSL, making all data transfers secure.
Any data on a site using HTTPS is encrypted and unreadable to third parties
unless they have the correct key. Most browsers show a “secure” indicator for
sites with HTTPS.

To use HTTPS on your site, you need an **SSL certificate**. Most hosting
platforms offer plans that include SSL — how you obtain it is up to you.

# How DNS Works

DNS stands for **Domain Name System**, and it’s like the internet’s phonebook.
It stores website addresses and translates IP addresses into human-readable
names.

When you host something on the web, it’s assigned an IP address (e.g.,
`192.46.254.15`). Memorizing these numbers is impractical, so DNS maps that IP
to a readable name like `www.example.com`.

Here’s how it works:

![DNS server diagram](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6164gdo33m7ajexxkmlp.png)

When the browser requests `www.gabriel.com`, the DNS returns the corresponding
IP so the browser can fetch the requested page’s files from the web server.

The organization that maintains IP address records is **ICANN (Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**, a nonprofit backed by global
committees.

# How Domains Work

As mentioned, every website is hosted at an IP address. DNS helps us convert
that into a domain name.

For example, in `http://www.mycoolsite.com`, everything after `www.` is the
**domain name**: `mycoolsite.com`.

The domain is your site’s unique address — what users type to access it, without
needing to know the IP.

To host a site, you must **register the domain** with a provider who coordinates
with ICANN (for international domains) or with RegistroBR (for Brazil). Domains
must be unique worldwide.

## National vs. International Domains

When registering a domain, you can choose between national or international
options.

### National Domains

In Brazil, domains are handled by **RegistroBR**. Common domains include
`.com.br`, but there are also specific ones like `.gov.br` or `.blog.br`.  
[See more domain categories](https://registro.br/dominio/categorias/)

### International Domains

These include `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, and others. They’re managed by ICANN and
can be used by anyone worldwide, including Brazilian sites.

# How Servers Work

### What Is a Server?

A server is essentially a powerful computer — often more powerful than typical
desktops — equipped with advanced CPUs, memory, cooling systems, and other
hardware.

Servers offer **centralized services**, meaning you only need to set up software
once on the server, and all connected devices can access it.

Examples of server services:

- Web hosting
- Databases
- Email services
- File storage
- VoIP systems
- Payment systems

### How Does It Work?

Each server type works differently, but let’s focus on **web servers**.

When you search for a website in your browser:

1. The **DNS** translates the domain into an IP.
2. The **HTTP/HTTPS** protocol sends a request to the web server.
3. The server responds with the site’s content.

If successful, you’ll see the webpage. The way servers store and deliver files
can vary widely.

# Conclusion

By the end of this article, you should have a solid understanding of how **HTTP,
HTTPS, DNS, domains, and servers** work. Play around in your browser’s **Network
tab** to explore these processes in action.

types**, **server hardware**, and practice with **HTTP methods**.
