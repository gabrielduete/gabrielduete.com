# About

To avoid losing important data or access to communication apps like WhatsApp on
your phone, I recommend using the **scrcpy** app. It allows you to mirror your
phone screen on your PC via USB.

scrcpy is especially useful if you're having trouble using your phone, in my
case, I needed to wait around 20 minutes for the screen to turn on after
pressing the power button.

# How to Use

Steps to install and use:

- [Go to the scrcpy GitHub repository](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)
- [Download the app according to your operating system (Windows, in my case)](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy):

- Extract the ZIP file.
- Now enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging on your phone.
- Each phone has a different path, but here’s a general guide:
- Go to Settings → System → About Phone → Software Information → Tap 7 times on
  **Build Number**
- You should see a message like “You are now a developer!”
- Go back and find **Developer Options**, then enable **USB Debugging**
- Connect your phone to your PC via USB.
- Open the folder where you extracted the ZIP file and run the `scrcpy.exe`

# Done!

You're now able to use your phone through your PC. If you prefer, you can also
connect your phone via Wi-Fi, I might add this feature to the article later.

Happy mirroring!
