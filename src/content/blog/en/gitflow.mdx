# Introduction

As developers, we work with Git almost every day. After all, version control
allows us to track changes made to our projects. Imagine the chaos before Linus
had that brilliant idea!

With Git came several workflow models that help us manage versioning. The most
popular and recommended today are trunk-based development and Gitflow.
Personally, I always use Gitflow in any project. So in this article, I’ll
introduce the main concepts of Gitflow.

It's helpful to have some basic knowledge of Git and software development to
better absorb the content, as I’ll be using some terms from these areas.

# What is Gitflow?

Gitflow was published and popularized by software engineer Vincent Driessen.
This model can be used in most projects—private or public—but it's especially
recommended for projects with scheduled releases and/or continuous delivery.
Keep in mind that you can always adapt the model to suit your team’s needs.

One of the main benefits of using Gitflow is that it avoids direct commits to
the production branch, which could lead to serious issues such as accidentally
deploying untested changes. Gitflow also provides other advantages like
structured pull request reviews, isolated experiments (POCs), and overall
improved team collaboration. Let’s dive deeper into how Gitflow works.

# Understanding Gitflow

Gitflow is based on two main branches:

- **Main/Master**: This is the production branch.
- **Develop**: This is the integration branch where all features are merged.

The `develop` branch contains the full commit history and serves as the base for
all feature branches. The `master` branch only receives finalized,
production-ready code from `develop`.

To configure `develop`, it’s ideal to have a senior developer create the branch
locally and push it to the remote repository. The `master` branch is already set
by default when creating a repository on GitHub.

With `main` and `develop` in place, we introduce a third branch: `feature`. A
feature branch is created locally by any developer working on a specific task
(feature, fix, or refactor). Once completed, a **pull request (PR)** should be
opened targeting the latest version of `develop`. After peer review and
approval, the feature is merged into `develop`.

Once `develop` has accumulated enough features, it can then be merged into
`master` for deployment.

Here's a diagram to illustrate this process:

![Gitflow basic branches](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ix1q2mppqw3nl774kh82.png)

Every orange dot represents a feature (PR). After approval, it’s merged into
`develop`, and once ready, all features are merged into `master` for a release.

# Release

The **release** branch acts as a bridge between `develop` and `master`, and is
where all pre-release testing happens. Once a release branch is created, **no
new features should be added**, only critical fixes.

If changes are needed, they should be made in a new `feature` branch, merged
into `develop`, and then merged again into the release branch.

Let’s look at this process visually:

![Gitflow with release](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/f0und0zmupw0c6t7v8b7.png)

As you can see, a release branch is created from `develop`, tested, and then
merged into `master`. After the release, `develop` must also be updated with the
latest production code to keep everything in sync.

# Hotfix

**Hotfix** branches are used to quickly patch production bugs without going
through the entire development workflow. They are extremely useful for critical
or unexpected bugs.

For example, if a login-breaking bug is deployed, it needs to be fixed ASAP.
Hotfixes are based directly on `master`, not `develop`. After the fix is
applied, the branch is merged into both `master` and `develop` (or `release`, if
it exists).

Here’s the updated flow including hotfixes:

![Gitflow with hotfix](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l10zap4ejatvgaij03zq.png)

Notice how hotfixes bypass the standard flow and update both `master` and
`develop` directly to solve the problem quickly.

# QA / Staging Environment

Gitflow can be tailored for specific project needs. Some teams use a **QA
branch** to test features individually before merging into `master`.

Here’s an example of such a workflow:

![Gitflow with QA branch](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzzmh353jt676lwqaoy2.png)

In this case, after a feature is developed, it's merged into both `develop` and
`QA`. QA tests it, and if approved, it can go straight to `master`.

# Development Flow

Understanding the full **development flow** helps developers know what actions
to take at each branch stage.

Here’s the complete Gitflow diagram including `release` and `hotfix`:

Now the step-by-step:

- **Local**:
  1. Create your feature branch from `develop`.
  2. Code the solution.
  3. Run unit tests and validate UI/business rules if needed.
- **Pull Request**:
  1. Submit the PR.
  2. Apply feedback or request changes.
  3. Once approved, merge into `develop`.
- **Develop**:
  1. Validate pipelines, tests, and builds.
  2. Prepare for release.
- **Release**:
  1. Test in staging/QA.
  2. Fix anything required through `develop`.
  3. Merge into `master`.
- **Production**:
  1. Final check on pipelines.
  2. Verify deployment.

Now let’s consider a Gitflow with QA for individual testing:

- Gitflow with QA:

- Development steps:

![QA testing flow](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ot064bla4o2ajtp5rp6c.png)

In this flow:

- Feature branches are based on `master`.
- PRs are merged into both `QA` and `DEV`.
- QA is where testing happens.
- Feedback loops can repeat PR creation and testing until everything is approved
  and merged into `master`.

# Conclusion

I hope this article helped you understand what Gitflow is and how it works. Each
team or company can customize the workflow to fit their processes.

To truly grasp Gitflow, try using it in a real project. Set up a README with
your Gitflow guidelines, and invite collaborators to follow the structure. It’s
a great way to maintain consistency and onboard contributors efficiently.

Happy coding! And if you need help, feel free to reach out on social media—just
