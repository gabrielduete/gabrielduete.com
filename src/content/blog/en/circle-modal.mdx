## Introduction

In software development, choosing the most appropriate life cycle model is
crucial to the project's success. Many traditional models follow a linear and
rigid structure, with little room for changes. However, more modern and
adaptable approaches—such as the **spiral model**—stand out for their
evolutionary nature.

## Why is the spiral model considered evolutionary?

Other life cycle models tend to be inflexible to change and follow a fixed path
from start to finish, completing a predefined sequence of steps to reach a
single goal outlined during the planning stage.

The **spiral life cycle model** is considered **evolutionary** because it is
**flexible to changes** and can be **easily adjusted according to the client's
requirements**.

This model allows the project to be modified during execution—whether by
**adding or removing features**, **changing the interface**, or **improving
usability**—always with a focus on the **client's needs and feedback**.

## Conclusion

Unlike traditional models, the spiral model offers an incremental and iterative
approach, making it ideal for projects with uncertainties or evolving
requirements.

This makes it a powerful choice for software development processes, especially
in scenarios that require **constant adaptation and continuous improvement**.
