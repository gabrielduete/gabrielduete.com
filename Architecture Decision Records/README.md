## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important
architectural decisions made during a project. They help:

- Document the reasoning behind decisions
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of the architecture
- Share knowledge across the team

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Context**: Why the decision was needed
3. **Decision**: What was decided
4. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated
